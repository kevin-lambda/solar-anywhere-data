          This is a planning tool that simulates energy output of a solar energy
          project using historical data for 2020 to 2023 based in Inner Sunset
          neighborhood of San Francisco.

          Because solar irradiation is variable, it can be a challenge to assess
          the potential energy output of a solar project from a given location.
          To solve this, the tool uses a given target system power, and creates
          an assumed baseline energy output and solar area. It uses these
          parameters and compares it to the historical data and results in data
          showing how many days would have met the baseline target energy
          output.
        </p>

          This project started as an effort to use solar data in a novel way.
          The goal is to solve a question or present data for a specific type of
          perspective. From that start, the function ended up being to project
          met or not met energy demand for a given solar project.
        </p>
        <p>
          To get to a full v1.0, next steps for this project are to incorporate
          costs. Which would analyze the total costs of a solar project,
          potential PPA revenue, vs the losses when energy demand days are not
          met and must be purchased from the grid.
