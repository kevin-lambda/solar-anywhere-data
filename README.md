## About

This project started as an effort to use solar data in a novel way. The goal is to solve a question or present data for a specific type of perspective. From that start, the function ended up being to project met or not met energy demand for a given solar project.

To get to v1.0, next steps for this project are to incorporate costs. Which would analyze the total costs of a solar project, potential PPA revenue, vs the losses when energy demand days are not met and must be purchased from the grid.
